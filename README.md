## What is out there

| | |
|---|---|
| 🌌 **Galaxy** | A family of genres: a dithered cloud of its star systems. Galaxies that share many releases sit side by side. |
| ⭐ **Star** | A Discogs style (Deep House, Acid, Dub Techno…). Its size is how many releases the style has, its glow is how alive it is today, and it **pulses at the style's typical tempo**, shedding a shell every bar. |
| 🪐 **Planet** | A label, orbiting its main style. Five kinds: **gas giants** (the biggest labels), **ringed worlds** (15+ years of releases), **cratered** (went quiet before 2001), **ice worlds** (started after 2010) and **terrestrial**. |
| 🛰️ **Satellites** | The label's tracks, older ones closer in. Up to 250 per planet, spread evenly over the label's whole history. |
| ☄️ **Asteroid belt** | Releases with no label or from very small ones, at the edge of each system. |

## What you can do

- **Zoom** with the wheel or two fingers: galaxies → systems → orbits → signals.
- **Open any object**: a dossier with its numbers, activity per year, neighbours and tracks.
- **Play**: tracks play in the embedded YouTube player.
- **Autopilot**: when a track ends, the ship flies on to the nearest track you haven't heard yet.
- **Odysseys**: start one from a star, then pick where to go (any other system). It visits 10 planets in 5 systems, entering and leaving each through "gate" labels that face the next system, with 20+ fresh tracks and its own shareable link.
- **Hitchhike the system**: on a star, thumb a ride round ten of its labels (from the big inner planets out to the edge), 42 tracks, a different ride every time.
- **Time warp**: on a planet, the label's story in order, one track a year from its first release to its last; defunct labels end on their last transmission.
- **Solaris station**: on a planet, park a radio station in its orbit: an endless radio of that label, and the player counts how many of its tracks you've heard.
- **Wormhole**: a jump to a random point in the cosmos. The signal scope in the dossier rides the jump with you.
- **Beacons**: mark the tracks you love. The **flight log** keeps your listening history. Both stay in your browser.
- **Share**: the address bar always holds a link to the current track or odyssey.

### On a phone

The map works with one and two fingers. While music plays, the player becomes a sheet along the bottom of the screen and the map gets the rest.

## Where the data comes from

The catalogue is the monthly **[Discogs data dump](https://data.discogs.com/)**, released under **CC0**, where releases already carry links to their videos.
stardig only embeds the official YouTube player. **Nothing is ever downloaded from YouTube**, and the player is always visible while it plays.

<details>
<summary><b>How the map is made</b></summary>

<br>

1. **Parse.** Discogs serves its dumps only to regular browsers, so the ~11 GB file is processed right in the browser: `pipeline/browser_parse.js` streams it on the Discogs page and saves `sectors.jsonl.gz`, which holds every release of every galaxy defined in `pipeline/sectors.json`.
2. **Merge.** `pipeline/catalog.py` folds the editions of a release into one entry and keeps those with videos.
3. **Build.** `pipeline/build_map.py` turns the catalogue into the map: stars and their links, galaxies packed so that neighbours face each other, planets on orbits, satellites, and asteroid belts. The build is deterministic.
4. **Publish.** The full map lives on the `data` branch. Every push to `main` builds the site and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

<summary><b>Under the hood</b></summary>

<br>

Plain TypeScript, no framework, built with Vite and drawn on two canvases:

- The **static layer** holds the grid, nebulae and belts. It is repainted only when the camera settles, and is slid and scaled by CSS in between.
- The **live layer** holds everything that moves, plus all names, and is redrawn every frame.

```
web/src/
  core/      types, small helpers, DOM access
  model/     pure logic: galaxy (planet types, star classes, tempo), motion (orbits), routes
  data/      fetching the map and each star's tracks
  store/     the visitor's own data: beacons, flight log, prefs
  cloud/     accounts and live data (Supabase): pilots, COMMS, fleets, the synced logbook
  app/       shared state, actions (select, play, next, plot an odyssey, wormhole), and the
             ports: what actions ask of the UI, filled in by the UI (so nothing imports in a circle)
  render/    camera, palette, layers, pulsars, planets, satellites, route line, picking
  ui/        dossier, player, odyssey panel, log & beacons, COMMS, pilot card, the message rail,
             overlays, search, input, effects
  styles/    tokens (type sizes, colours, layers), then one file per part of the terminal
web/test/    Vitest
web/e2e/     two browsers against a stand-in for Supabase: fleets, tune in, fleet chat
pipeline/    Python: parse → catalogue → map, with pytest
supabase/    the database: tables, rules, live channels (schema.sql)
```

The interface speaks in one place: the **message rail** along the top of the map (a mode in progress,
on air, ✓ done, ! trouble), or the top of an open card. Errors in a form show right under it.

Every push runs types, lint (ESLint, ruff) and tests for the site and the pipeline. The site is deployed only if they pass.

## Next on the flight plan

- [ ] Accounts: beacons and flight log synced between devices, public beacon collections
- [ ] Search by track title
- [ ] Live-video checks, so dead satellites go dark
- [x] New galaxies: Downtempo, Experimental, Electro, Synth & Wave, UK Bass, Hardcore, Eurodance
- [ ] A fresh map every month, straight from the new Discogs dump
- [ ] Its own domain
