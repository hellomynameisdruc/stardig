"""Step 2½. From the raw releases picked out of the dump (sectors.jsonl.gz: every release of every
sector, as it is) to the catalogue: editions of the same master merged into one point, each YouTube
video kept once (the first time it appears), and each release tagged with the sectors it belongs to
(`secs`). Sectors become galaxies on the one map.

The merge is the one the old house-only parser did (sector_catalogue gives exactly its output).
